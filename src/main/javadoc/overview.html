FasterSQL lets you write SQL using plain Java, by emulating the syntax and structure of SQL DQL and DML statements
using a set of predefined classes, factories and methods representing the clauses, expressions and functions
from the SQL language. A Java DSL (Domain Specific Language) for database operations.
