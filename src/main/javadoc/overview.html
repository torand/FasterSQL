FasterSQL lets you write SQL using plain Java, by emulating the syntax and structure of SQL Data Query Language and
Data Manipulation Language statements using a set of predefined classes, factories and methods representing the clauses,
expressions and functions from the SQL language. A light-weight Java DSL (Domain Specific Language) to simplify JDBC
database operations.
